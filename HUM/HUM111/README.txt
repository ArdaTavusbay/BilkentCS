------------------
The Epic of Gilgamesh, 2nd ed. Translated by Andrew George. Penguin Books, 2020.

Exercise 2
------------------
How was our discussion and analysis of The Epic of Gilgamesh useful for understanding the themes and characters of Oedipus the King, or vice versa, how did reading Oedipus help you understand Gilgamesh? Some things you might consider are the type of relationships we see in both texts (social/political/personal); the values expressed in the poems; ideas about the gods; boundaries and links between gods, humans, and animals; the nature of kingship; city vs. wilderness; persuasion, whether successful or not; etc., etc. Note that while this exercise is subjective to a degree, you are still being graded on your understanding of the texts, use of evidence to support claims, and the clarity and organization of your response.
